Page is the fundament of our platform. It allows you to define which content will be shown at given path. All pages have to be located in `/pages` directory. Each page is represented by a single file with extension liquid. Here is a sample file for configuring home page:
{% raw %}
# pages/home.liquid
```liquid
---
slug: /
format: html
layout_name: application
---
<h1>Welcome to my page</h1>
<p>A paragraph explaining what we do</p>
```
{% endraw %}

Property | Description | Default | Example
--- | --- | --- | ---
`slug` | defines the url at which this page will be accessible. Assuming your marketplace domain is https://example.com, you will be able to access the page at https://example.com/`<slug>`. Homepage is exception - for homepage use '/', which will work for both https://example.com and https://example.com/ ] | n/a | my-page
`format` | defines for which format the endpoint will be available. For example, if you want to respond to /sitemap.xml, you will specify xml format. Valid formats are: html, xml, csv, txt, json. | html | txt
`layout_name` | defines which layout from `liquid_views/layouts/` you would like to use. | application | my_custom_layout
`path` | name might be a bit misleading, but currently it is used to generate the default `<title>` tag | n/a | My Page

There are other options available - for example, you can create page that redirects somewhere else (useful if you want to rename slug but there are external sources linking to the old slug for example) etc.

Everything after the front matter is the body of the page. Depending on the format, it should be either html or json. In this example, it is simple html consisting of `h1` and `p` tags.

Information provided in this section should be enough to create any number of static pages, implementing any layout you want.
