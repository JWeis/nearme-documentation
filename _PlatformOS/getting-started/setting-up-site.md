This guide will help you set up a site on our platform.

## Requirements

You can set up and configure your site through the Partner Portal, so you have to have access to it. If you don't have a registered Partner account, follow this tutorial:

* [Accessing Our Partner Portal]()

## Steps

Setting up a site through the Partner Portal is a two-step process:

1.  Create a new Instance
2.  Set a password for the Instance

### Step 1: Create a new Instance

Log in to our [Partner Portal](http://portal.apps.near-me.com), locate your Partner account in the list, and click on the `Instances` link next to it.

{% include alert/note.html content="Think of Instances as sites. To learn more about the concepts behind Platform OS and our Partner Portal, go to [How Platform OS works]() " %}

You see a list of your Instances (or none, if you haven't created one yet). Click on the `New Instance` button.
Add a Name, and select an endpoint. Endpoints for staging sites have a "staging-" prefix.

Click on the `Create` button. We create the Instance, and once it's done, send you an email with further instructions.

### Step 2: Set a password for the Instance

In the email you received, click on the link of your newly created Instance. You see your Instance, click on the `Log In` button.

To set your password for the Instance, click on the `Reset your password` link. Enter your email, and click on the `Reset Password` button. Follow the instructions we send you in email to set your password.

## Next steps

Congratulations! You have created an Instance that you can deploy to.
