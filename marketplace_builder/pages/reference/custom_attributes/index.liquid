Custom Attributes are used to build custom forms and gather input from the user.

[User defined](./user-defined) are your custom attributes that you can create on demand.

Our platform also provides a few custom attributes for you so you don't have to write them on your own.

* [Custom addresses](./custom-addresses) - Custom addresses are used to add one or many addresses to edited profile.
* Custom images - TODO
