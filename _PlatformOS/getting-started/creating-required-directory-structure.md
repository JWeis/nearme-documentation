This guide will help you create the required directory structure with the [Blank Marketplace Module](https://github.com/mdyd-dev/module-blank-marketplace).

In order to correctly communicate with the Platform OS engine and API, your code base should be organized into a specific directory structure. The root directory of your project should contain the `marketplace_builder` directory. All directories other than the `marketplace_builder` will be ignored by the Marketplace Kit when deploying and syncing, so you can keep all your JS and CSS files outside of the `marketplace_builder` directory, and use any pre-processors you want to automatically generate the end result files in a proper path inside `marketplace_builder`.

## Requirements

You can create the required directory structure using the Blank Marketplace Module. To use this module, you have to have the Marketplace Kit installed on your computer.

## Steps

Creating the required directory structure with the Blank Marketplace Module is a two-step process:

1.  Install the Blank Marketplace Module
2.  Explore your directory structure

### Step 1: Install the Blank Marketplace Module

To install the Blank Marketplace Module, enter:

```
npm i @platform-os/blank-marketplace
```

{% include alert/note.html content="Make sure you invoke this command where you have permissions to create a directory." %}

The installer asks you to enter the name of your marketplace. This information will be used to name the directory where the required directory structure will be installed.

### Step 2: Explore your directory structure

Once you've installed the required directory structure, locate and explore itâ€”this is how your code base for your Platform OS Instances should be organized.

To learn more about the required directories and files, see [Platform OS Components]().

## Next steps

Congratulations! You have created the required file structure for your code base using the Blank Marketplace Module. You can now deploy and sync changes to your Instance.
