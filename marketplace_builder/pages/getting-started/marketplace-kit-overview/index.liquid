[Marketplace Kit](https://github.com/mdyd-dev/marketplace-kit) is command line tool, which was developed to allow you to easily deploy your configuration files and assets to the Platform OS. It expects you to follow a certain file structure in order to correctly communicate with the Platform OS API. You do not have to use it, however it is highly recommended that you do. It is a CLI tool, hence you are expected to have basic knowledge in working with Terminal.

Please [see readme](https://github.com/mdyd-dev/marketplace-kit) for complete usage guide and examples.
