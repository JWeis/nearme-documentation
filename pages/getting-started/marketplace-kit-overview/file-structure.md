It is expected that the root directory of your project would contain `marketplace_builder` directory. All directories other than `marketplace_builder` will be ignored by gem. Hence, you can keep all your js, css files outside of marketplace_builder and use whatever pre-processors you want to automatically generate end result files in proper path inside `marketplace_builder`.

Here is the usual content of the directory, along with a short explanation about each file or directory:

* `.builder` - this is configuration files, which determines which endpoints are available. Usually, you want to have two endpoints - staging and production.
* `instance_attributes.yml` - configuration files, which define things like allowed countries within marketplace, allowed currencies etc.
* `assets` - this directory is used to put static assets in there - css, js, images. See section about [adding web assets](/getting-started/pages/adding-web-assets) for information how to use it.
* `authorization_policies` - used to configure [Authorization Policies](/reference/authorization-policy/), which defines rules that control whether user has access to certain form and/or page. Files inside this directory should have `liquid` extension.
* `categories` - allows you to define [Categories](/reference/categories/), which you can then associate with UserProfiles, Transactables or Orders. Try to avoid using those if possible - most of the time, [Custom Attributes](/reference/custom-attributes/)  will be sufficient, and it is way easier to work with Custom Attributes than with Categories. Files are expected to have `yml` extension.
* `custom_model_types` - defines [Custom Model Types](/reference/custom-model-types/), which you will be able to use. Files are expected to have `yml` extension.
* `form_configurations` - Includes all [Form Configurations](/reference/form-configurations), which are a representation of a form available in your website. Each of the `liquid` files should include both configuration (including associated authorization policies, notifications etc), along with liquid code which renders html.
* `graph_queries` - Includes `.graphql` files, each defining one [GraphQL Query](/reference/graphql/) - think of those as defining a query to our data store; you can use graphql queries in any liquid code.
* `instance_profile_types` - Files in this directory defines [User Profiles](/reference/instance-profile-types/) . Each marketplace includes one user role, called 'default', hence each marketplace needs to include the `default.yml` file inside this directory. If you would like to distinguish one group of users from the other (for example buyers vs sellers), you need to create a new file for each role.
* `liquid_views` - this directory contains layouts and partials - re-usable snippets of liquid code, which usually is used to render html. If you create a file with relative path `a/b/c.liquid`, then adding {% raw%}`{% include 'a/b/c' %}`{%endraw%} would inject the code included there.
* `mailers` - deprecated, please use `noifications/email_notifications` instead. We need to keep it for backwards compatibility reasons.
* `notifications` - contains files that define [Notifications](/reference/notifications/), which then can be associated with Form Configuration.
* `pages` - this directory allows you to define [Pages](/reference/pages/) - the heart of our platform. For each page you can configure a slug, i.e. the path at which it will be available and the liquid code, which will generate proper html.
* `reservation_types` - used to define [Order Types](/reference/order-types/). Order Type represents an action which should be allowed in your marketplace - for example booking (i.e. making reservation), subscription etc.
* `sms` - deprecated, please use `notifications/sms_notifications` instead.
* `topics` - define Topics for community marketplaces
* `transactable_types` - defines [Transactable Types](/reference/transactable-types/), which describe resources against which Orders will be created
* `translations` - contain `yml` files, which include [Translations](/reference/transactable-types/). They are mainly used for multi-lingual marketplaces, however you can also use them to define format of a date [for example, whether you want to use mm/dd/YYYY vs dd.mm.YYYY or any other), or flash messages returned by the api (i.e. notifications that action was successful)
