The heart of payments is a concept around PaymentGateway. We do not process money ourselelves; instead, we have integrated with multiple reliable third party systems, such as [Stripe](https://stripe.com) or [PayPal](https://www.paypal.com). PaymentGateway can be configured only in InstanceAdmin at `/instance_admin/settings/payments`.

Near Me supports the following Payment gateway integrations:

* AuthorizeNet
* Braintree (payIN)
* Braintree Marketplace (full cycle, payIN and automated payOUT)
* Fetch
* Ogone
* Paypal Payments Pro
* Paypal Adaptive Payments (payOUT)
* Paypal Express (payIN)
* Paypal Express Chained Payments (full cycle, payIN and automated payOUT)
* PayStation
* SagePay
* Spreedly
* Stripe (payIN)
* [Stripe Connect (full cycle, payIN and automated payOUT)](/guides/stripe-connect-integration/)
* Worldpay
* Offline Payment
