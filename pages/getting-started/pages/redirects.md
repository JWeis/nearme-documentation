By using Page, you can also implement redirects. Here is example how you can redirect /my-page to /other-page using 302 status:
{% raw %}

```yaml
---
slug: my-page
redirect_to: /other-page
redirect_code: 302
---
```

{% endraw %}

* `slug` - defines the url at which this page will be accessible. In this example, assuming your marketplace domain is `https://example.com`, you will be able to access the page at `https://example.com/about`.
* `redirect_to` - endpoint to which you want user to be redirected
* `redirect_code` - specifies the status of redirection. Can be either 301 (Moved Permanently) or 302 (Found)
