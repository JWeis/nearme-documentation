Written documentation will now become a part of regular process of writing code and become a part of the development cycle. To achieve that we will introduce a following process for every developer to follow when writing any code:.

[![Documentation Standard](/images/documentation_process.png)](/images/documentation_process.png)

## Permalinks


### Structure
Documentation is separated into following sections:

* *Getting started* - step by step description of setting up a marketplace
* *How-to* - list of common use patterns
    * Connecting to social media sites
    * Split registration
    * Configuring asset build process with webpack and sass
    * ...
* *Reference*
  * API endpoints
  * Liquid drops
    * Transactable
    * User
    * ...
  * Custom Filters
    * Text filters (?)
    * Price filters (?)
    * ...
  * Marketplace Builder configuration
    * ...
    * ...
  * Form Builder configuration
    * ...
    * ...
  * GraphQL properties
    * ...
* *Meta*
  * Contributing
  * Standard (this document)

Based on this structure we create permalinks using folder structure, where each nested level is another folder, e.g

```!text
Reference > Liquid Drops > User => /reference/liquid-drops/user
How to > Split Registration => /how-to/split-registration
```

### Top level file

Make sure that every folder contains an`index.html` file, which should be either:

* standalone document describing the concept, e.g. what API structure we use, what are custom filters in liquid, etc., or
* Table of Contents for this section, but that will require either maintaining links by hand or writing custom handler for navigation, or
* the first link in the navigation structure e.g. `Meta > Contributing => meta/index.html`

### Format

* Use only lower case letters
* Use hyphen `-` as the separator for words
* Do not add `.html` suffix, it's not necessary

## Page settings

Every page can have meta data set via [YAML Front Matter](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/frontmatter/) .

* `title` - HTML title, good title is crucial for improving findability
* `summary` - This is used in search engines to provide a description of the search result. Make sure itâ€™s short and to the point - *it needs to fit below 70 characters*
* `tags` - array of tags that will be used for creating a search index. Make sure to not overdo it.
* `sidebar` - select which sidebar will be displayed
* `folder` - select active folder in the sidebar
* `layout` - if more than one layout is available, you can select it here

### Example
```!yaml
---
title: Get access to our platform
tags: [getting_started]
summary: "Get access to our platform"
sidebar: getting_started_sidebar
permalink: getting-started/get-access.html
folder: getting_started
layout: page
