This guide will help you invite a new User to our Partner Portal, so that the new User—depending on the permissions you assign to them—can create, manage and configure Instances, and create and manage the permissions of other Partners. 

## Requirements
To be able to invite a new User to the Partner Portal, you have to have access to our Partner Portal.  

* [Accessing Our Partner Portal]()

## Steps 

Inviting a new User to our Partner Portal is a two-step process:

1.   Create new Partner
2.   Create new User for the Partner

### Step 1: Create new Partner

Log in to our [Partner Portal](https://portal.apps.near-me.com). You see the list of Partners you have access to. 

Each new Partner you create has to have a Parent Partner. Select the Parent Partner and click on its name. 

Click on `New Partner`, enter a name, and click on `Create`. The Partner has been created, and the information page of the newly created Partner is displayed.   

### Step 2: Create new User for the Partner

The new Partner you created has one User: you. So that other people can access our Partner Portal through this Partner, create a new User. 

Click on `New User`, enter the user's email address, and click `Invite User`. The user will receive an invitation email with instructions on how to access the Partner Portal. 

## Next steps
Congratulations! You have invited a new User to our Partner Portal. Now, you can set up the permissions of this new User.
