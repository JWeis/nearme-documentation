Setting up ACH payments via Stripe / Stripe Connect using an account with [Plaid.com](https://plaid.com/) can be done in just a few simple steps.

**Important note:** You will need to sign up or have an existing Stripe account and have set up your Stripe or Stripe Connect integration on your marketplace first. You can find more information on [setting up a Stripe integration](http://support.near-me.com/article/81-integrating-stripe) or [setting up a Stripe Connect integration](http://support.near-me.com/article/565-integrating-stripe-connect) on our support site\*\*.

Once that is complete, simply follow the steps below to set up ACH Payments on your Platform OS marketplace.

## Sign up for an account at Plaid.com

1.  Go to [Plaid registration page](https://dashboard.plaid.com/signup/stripe) and sign up for a new account

    **Important note:** At this point you have a Free account with Plaid and can use the Sandbox Server to test and the Development Server for your first 100 users. You can move on to [Connect your Plaid.com and Stripe.com accounts](#connect-your-plaidcom-and-stripecom-accounts) and complete the set up using the SandBox or Development Servers. Once you reach 100 users or you are ready to begin your paid Plaid account, you'll return need to complete the next steps and apply for it via [Plaid.com](https://plaid.com/)

5.  The final step for your paid Plaid account is to Contact [Plaid.com](https://plaid.com/) and request that your account be Upgraded to access their production (LIVE) environment. You can do this under _Remove User Limits_
    [![Remove User Limits option](/assets/images/guides/payment-gateways/stripe-connect/file-Vqly5f4sF9.png)](/assets/images/guides/payment-gateways/stripe-connect/file-Vqly5f4sF9.png)
    This will open up a form to fill that needs to be filled out with information about your company and how you plan on using the product. You'll want to provide these answers to the following questions on the form:
    1.  What are you building: **Marketplace**
    2.  What products do you plan to use: Auth: **routing/account number authentication**
    3.  How many users: **0-500**

Once you submit this form for approval, you will receive an email notification from Plaid letting you know when your account has been upgraded. At this point you'll want to move your Environment from Development to Production in your marketplace's Admin Dash.
