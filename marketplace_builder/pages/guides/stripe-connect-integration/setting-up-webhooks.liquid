This article will help you set up webhooks for your Stripe Connect Payment Gateway. The reason we need to do this is so that your marketplace doesn't need to pull information from Stripe, they will push important information to your marketplace when important events occur. [You can read more about Webhooks here](https://stripe.com/docs/webhooks).

**Please note:** there are 2 types of webhooks based on how your marketplace chooses to pay for the Stripe Processing Fees, [Platform](#platform-webhooks) and [Direct](#direct-webhooks). Please choose the correct webhook based on your marketplace.

Webhooks are sent by Stripe to notify NearMe platform about an event - for example, that merchant account was verified, or that transfer has been successful.
