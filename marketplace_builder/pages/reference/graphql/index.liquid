## What is GraphQL

[GraphQL](http://graphql.org/learn/) is a data query language that use strong type system. A GraphQL query is a string
interpreted by a server that returns data in a specified format.

{% include alert/tip.html content="There is an excellent blog post about what all the parts of GraphQL query (and
mutations for that matter) -
<a href='https://dev-blog.apollodata.com/the-anatomy-of-a-graphql-query-6dffa9e9e747' rel='external noopener' target='_blank'>The
anatomy of a graphql query</a>. We highly recommend reading it to understand it better." %}

Here is an example query:

```graphql
query get_user($slug: String) {
  user(slug: $slug) {
    slug
    email
    first_name
    last_name
    address {
      city
    }
  }
}
```

And here is the response to that query:

```js
{
  "user": {
    "slug": "jane",
    "email": "jane@example.com",
    "first_name": "Jane",
    "last_name": "Doe",
    "address": {
      "city": "Toronto"
    }
  }
}
```

In query you can select exactly what you need. Editor will show available fields and allow run queries.

## GraphQL in Liquid

You can store queries and use them in liquid with `query_graph` tag.

{% raw %}

```liquid
{% query_graph 'users_query', result_name: 'g', slug: 'jane' %}

{{ g.user.first_name }} {{ g.user.last_name }} {{ g.user.address.city }}
```

{% endraw %}
