## Technologies

Our documentation is based on Jekyll and is hosted by [Github](https://github.com).

## Tools

### Prose - recommended

To make editing process as easy as possible, link "Edit this page" is pointing to an amazing tool called [Prose](https://prose.io) which is an WYSIWYG editor for Github stored files. It also has Jekyll support so you can easily edit meta data (Title, tags, keywords, permalink etc.)

Watch how to use prose.io to edit pages made by one of the users.

### Command line

You can [clone](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/) (or [fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/)) our repository ({{ site.repository }}), make your changes and submit PR to the original

### Github

Integrated [edit feature](https://help.github.com/articles/editing-files-in-your-repository/) within github is the quickest way to start contributing your changes.

## Syntax

Our documentation is written in Markdown. You can use Liquid inside this markdown because Jekyll will parse it.

[See example gist](https://jsbin.com/zokide/1) of Liquid and javascript snippets of code.

## Documentation Standards

Written documentation will now become a part of regular process of writing code and become a part of the development cycle. To achieve that we will introduce a following process for every developer to follow when writing any code:.

### Permalinks


#### Structure
Documentation is separated into following sections:

* *Getting started* - step by step description of setting up a marketplace
* *How-to* - list of common use patterns
* *Reference* - list of all APIs, drops, graphql properties etc
* *Contribute* - how to contribute to the documentation

Based on this structure we create permalinks using folder structure, where each nested level is another folder, e.g

```!text
Reference > Liquid Drops > User => /reference/liquid-drops/user
How to > Split Registration => /how-to/split-registration
```

#### Top level file

Make sure that every folder contains an`index.html` file, which should be either:

* standalone document describing the concept, e.g. what API structure we use, what are custom filters in liquid, etc., or
* Table of Contents for this section, but that will require either maintaining links by hand or writing custom handler for navigation, or
* the first link in the navigation structure e.g. `Meta > Contributing => meta/index.html`

#### Format

* Use only lower case letters
* Use hyphen `-` as the separator for words
* Do not add `.html` suffix, it's not necessary

### Page settings

Every page can have meta data set via [YAML Front Matter](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/frontmatter/).

* `title` - HTML title, good title is crucial for improving findability
* `summary` - This is used in search engines to provide a description of the search result. Make sure itâ€™s short and to the point - *it needs to fit below 70 characters*
* `tags` - array of tags that will be used for creating a search index. Make sure to not overdo it.
* `sidebar` - select which sidebar will be displayed
* `folder` - select active folder in the sidebar
* `layout` - if more than one layout is available, you can select it here

#### Example
```!yaml
