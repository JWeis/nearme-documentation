Custom Attributes are used to build custom forms and gather input from the user.

[User defined](./user-defined) custom attirbutes: custom attributes you can create on demand.

Our platform also provides a few custom attributes for you, so that you don't have to write them on your own.

* [Custom addresses](./custom-addresses): used to add one or many addresses to the configuration.

* [Custom images](./custom-images): used to add one or many images to the configuration.

* [Custom attachments](./custom-attachments): used to add one or many files to the configuration.
