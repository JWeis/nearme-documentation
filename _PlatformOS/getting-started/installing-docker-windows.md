This guide will help you install Docker on Windows. You will need Docker to install and use the Platform OS Marketplace Kit, that allows you to easily deploy your configuration files and assets to our platform, and communicate with the Platform OS API.  

## Requirements

Docker for Windows requires 64bit Windows 10 Pro with Hyper-V available.  For a full list of requirements go to Docker's [What to know before you install](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/#what-to-know-before-you-install) page. 

## Steps 

Installing Docker on Windows is a two-step process:

1.   Download  `Docker for Windows Installer.exe`
2.   Install Docker

### Step 1: Download Docker for Windows Installer.exe
Download [Docker for Windows Installer.exe](https://download.docker.com/win/stable/Docker%20for%20Windows%20Installer.exe).  

Locate the `Docker for Windows Installer.exe` file you downloaded in your Downloads folder (or the folder you selected for download). You can also run it from the recent downloads bar at the bottom of your web browser.

### Step 2: Install Docker

Run  `Docker for Windows Installer.exe`, and follow the install wizard to accept the license, authorize the installer, and proceed with the install. You are asked to authorize  `Docker.app`  with your system password during the install process. Privileged access is needed to install networking components, links to the Docker apps, and manage the Hyper-V VMs. 

Docker does not start automatically. To start it, search for Docker, select the app in the search results, and click it.  

## Next steps
Congratulations! You have installed Docker on Windows. Now you can go on, and install the Platform OS Marketplace Kit.
