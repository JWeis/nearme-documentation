Editing home page differs from editing any other page. The content of the home page is located at `liquid_views/home/index.liquid`. You can provide any html you want there, for example as simple as:
{% raw %}
```liquid
<h1>Welcome to the home page!</h1>
```
{% endraw %}

In later section it will be shown how to make it dynamic by using various liquid tags and liquid filters.
