Besides standard knowledge of technologies that are used to build web sites - HTML, CSS, JavaScript (including JSON, AJAX), we wanted to highlight few languages you might not be familiar with. Please note, that you can use any tools and pre-processors you want, when it comes to working with CSS, JavaScript etc.

## YAML

YAML is a well known human friendly data serialization. You will use it in configuration files to set properties. For reference, check [Official YAML Documentation](http://www.yaml.org/start.html)

## Liquid

Liquid is a template language. You will use it mainly to build dynamic pages. A side use of liquid is to provide dynamic configuration, for example based on currently logged user or any other business rules. Using liquid you will be able to provide authorization policy for forms / pages or specify whether notification (email, sms, api call) should be sent. If you are not familiar with liquid, a good starting point to learn liquid is [Official Liquid Documentation](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/). Please note, that we have added a lot of filters and tags to make your life easier.

## GraphQL

GraphQL is a query language. You will use it to communicate with out data storages. For reference, check [Official GraphQL Documentation](http://graphql.org/learn/)
