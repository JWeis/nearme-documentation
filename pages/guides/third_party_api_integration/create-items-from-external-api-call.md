To create transactables from existing data you can make an api call to our service. 

In order to make it we need:
- TransactableType
- FormConfiguration
- Api token
- curl command


## TransactableType

```
# transactable_types/flowers.yml
---
name: Flowers
default_currency: USD
enable_photo_required: false
require_transactable_during_onboarding: false
skip_location: false
skip_payment_authorization: false
slug: flowers
```

## FormConfiguration

Here we define what data we expect and required validations.

```
# form_configurations/import_flowers.liquid
---
name: import_flowers
base_form: TransactableForm
configuration:
  name:
    validation:
      presence: true
  creator_id:
resource_owner: anyone
---
```

## Api token

You need to generate it from instance admin [Settings -> Api Keys -> Generate new API Key]

## curl command

Here is example POST request you need to send. You need to set:
- token in header
- data payload in a JSON format 

```
curl https://demo.near-me.com/api/user/transactables 
  -H "Authorization: Token token=1dfa2c5df68a82285bc55159982bdd15" 
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json'  
  --data '{"form":{"name": "Red flowers", "creator_id":"1" }, "form_configuration_name": "import_flowers", "parent_object_class":"TransactableType","parent_object_id":"flowers"}'
```
