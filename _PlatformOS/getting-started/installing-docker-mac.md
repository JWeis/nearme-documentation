This guide will help you install Docker on a Mac. You will need Docker to install and use the Platform OS Marketplace Kit, that allows you to easily deploy your configuration files and assets to our platform, and communicate with the Platform OS API.  

## Requirements

Docker for Mac requires OS X El Capitan 10.11 or newer macOS release running on a 2010 or newer Mac, with Intelâ€™s hardware support for MMU virtualization. The app runs on 10.10.3 Yosemite, but with limited support.  For a full list of requirements go to Docker's [What to know before you install](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/#what-to-know-before-you-install) page. 

## Steps 

Installing Docker on a Mac is a two-step process:

1.   Download `Docker.dmg`
2.   Install Docker

### Step 1: Download Docker.dmg
Download [Docker.dmg](https://download.docker.com/mac/stable/Docker.dmg). 

Locate the Docker.dmg file you downloaded in your Downloads folder (or the folder you selected for download). 

### Step 2: Install Docker

Double-click the `Docker.dmg` file you downloaded. In the window that pops up, drag and drop the Docker icon to your Applications folder. Open Finder, and locate Docker among your applications in the Applications folder. 

## Next steps
Congratulations! You have installed Docker on your Mac. Now you can go on, and install the Platform OS Marketplace Kit.
