Notification framework has been written to provide you the way to define what should happen after form is submitted.

Currently, we support three types of notification:

* [Email](./emails)
* [SMS](./smses)
* [API call](./api-calls)

All notifications are defined in `notifications` directory. Once you create a notification, you can associate it with any form you want. In the following sections, an example will be provided of each notification type.
