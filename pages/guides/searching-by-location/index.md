If you gather information about your user's location you can easily search them using one of following methods:

1. [Bounding box](/guides/searching-by-location/bounding-box) - giving coordinates of two points, ie. `top left` and `bottom right` - this can be used to find users that are within visible rectangle of the map showing the results

2. Circle - giving coordinates of the center point and radius which you want to search - this can be used to find users that are close enough to provide a service

3. Polygon - giving coordinates of as many points as you want - this can be used to trace state, neighbourhood, district.
