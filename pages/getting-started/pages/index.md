In this section we will explain basic concept about layouts, pages and partials.

After reading this section, you should be able to:

* create your own layout, that will be re-used by many pages
* add new pages available at uri you desire
* use static assets on each of your pages - css, js, images, fonts and whatever comes to your mind
* extract code that repeats across multiple pages into partials, making your code easier to maintain
